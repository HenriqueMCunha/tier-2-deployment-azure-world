# Feedback On Presentation

## Individual Feedback

### Artie

* Very good and conversational.
* Good pace and delivery.
* There could have been better time management by not going too into depth regarding the detail we went into with the VPC rather focusing more on our Azure deployment as well as pointing out the differences.

### Affiq

* Very good pace and delivery.

### Henrique

* Be careful with analogies as they can be confusing if not delivered properly (too long-winded).
* If doing an analogy, fully commit to it.
* Good pace and delivery.


## Group Feedback

* Focus felt halved regarding AWS and Azure when it should have been more on Azure.
* Maybe a little bit too complex.
* If going into detail, better to do it with the Azuer side rather than the AWS.
* Good and broad communication but might have missed some detail along the way.

## Powerpoint Feedback

* Good slide design on containerization section (Careful to not use too many colours as it can become a distraction).
* Good to highlight sections but it can get confusing, so better to highlight when talking and then remove highlight.
* Azure topology graph confusing, didn't simplify enough.
