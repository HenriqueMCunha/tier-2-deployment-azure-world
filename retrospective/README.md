# Retrospective

## Process wise:
* Should have documented for each successful (and unsuccessful) increment instead of documenting at the end of several increments.
* Researched Azure terminology more thoroughly. 
* Should have focused on a good balance of technical-presentation-documentation for each increment.
* Make use of SCRUM methodology
* More pair programming to ensure knowledge is shared - in circumstances of one person going missing and the project stalling
  
## Presentation wise:
* Don't overcomplicate with analogies - keep them relatively simple
* Keep designs consistent (bullet point slides consistent)
* Limit use of colours - especially bright colours
* Consider the time span - show necessary information and don't neglect original requirements (i.e. talking about the AWS setup rather than the Azure setup)
* Consider visual aids for certain aspects (i.e. Azure slides)
