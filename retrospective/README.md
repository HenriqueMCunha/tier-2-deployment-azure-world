# Retrospective

## Process wise:
* Should have documented for each successful (and unsuccessful) increment instead of documenting at the end of several increments.
* Researched Azure terminology more thoroughly. 
* Should have focused on a good balance of technical-presentation-documentation for each increment.
* Make use of SCRUM methodology
* More pair programming to ensure knowledge is shared - in circumstances of one person going missing and the project stalling
  
## Presentation wise:
* Don't overcomplicate with analogies - keep them relatively simple
* Keep designs consistent (bullet point slides consistent)
* Limit use of colours - especially bright colours
* Consider the time span - show necessary information and don't neglect original requirements (i.e. talking about the AWS setup rather than the Azure setup)
* Consider visual aids for certain aspects (i.e. Azure slides)


## Appreciations:

Very exceptional communication as well as enthusiasm to tackle the project - even in the face of obstacles, we did not let it damper us down.

## What Went Well (Keep):

This sprint, we did exceptionally well in quickly deploying the task. Our team's ability to communicate problems concisely and narrow the scope of each problem was a key factor in our success. The positive energy during each increment also played a crucial role.

## Areas for Improvement (Stop/Change):

While we did achieve a lot, it's important to address the challenges we faced, namely investing too many time into the Docker increment whilst leaving the presentation neglected. Additionally, we should reflect on the work-document cycle process, which we should consider refining.

## Process Reflection:

Our current processes served us well in the cloud development process. However, we should evaluate if there are areas where adjustments could lead to more efficient workflows - perhaps a pair-programming approach where an individual codes and another researches or documents would speed up efficiency.
